Handy Helper

Handy Helper is a Python Full Stack Web Application that I built in under 5 hours, based on a wireframe I had never seen before. 
The main focus of the exam is implementing specific features, including validations for the login and registration forms. 
The exams are graded on functionality only, not design, so CSS is minimal due to time constraints.

Handy Helper allows registered users to post jobs for other users to complete.

The dashboard displays the jobs that the logged-in user has agreed to complete, as well as any other jobs currently available.
The logged-in user will be able to edit or delete the jobs they have created.
However, they can only view the other jobs, or add them to their list.
Giving up on a job will return it to the main table, while marking it as done will remove it from the database.

The logged-in user can create new job and assign them to one or more categories.

Clicking on one of the jobs on the dashboard will redirect the user to a page displaying the details about that particular job.
If the job is not on their list, they can add it from this page.
If they have already added the job to their list, they will have the options of giving up or marking it as complete.
